# Science

* [Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/science)
* [Source](https://github.com/RyanScottLewis/science)
* [Documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/science/frames)

Science, as homosapiens understand it, written in Ruby.

## Install

### Bundler: `gem 'science'`

### RubyGems: `gem install science`

## Usage

## TODO

* Alot. I mean, a *whole* lot. see the `Contributing` section below to help!
* Each and every module may have different dependencies.
  Because of this, each module must be abstracted to it's own gem.  
  For example, the `Science::PhysicalGeography::Elevation` module will be abstracted to the
  `science-physical_geography-elevation` gem, which will then become a dependency of this gem.

## Contributing

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile or VERSION.
